# simple_adaptive_cruise_control_robot_vehicle
This is an autonomous vehicle that operates using PID control feedback from an ultrasound sensor. Thanks to this, the vehicle can maintain a constant distance from an obstacle in front of it. It is constructed using 3D-printed PLA and the control is based on Arduino.

This is the second project of the "ME4250 Mechatronics" course, taught by Carolina Silva and Leslie Cardenas at the University of Chile.
