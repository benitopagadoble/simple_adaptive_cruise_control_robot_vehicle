# simple_adaptive_cruise_control_robot_vehicle
This is an autonomous vehicle that operates using PID control feedback from an ultrasound sensor. Thanks to this, the vehicle can maintain a constant distance from an obstacle in front of it. It is constructed using 3D-printed PLA and the control is based on Arduino.
